# Visual Studio Code Coding Stats Extension

__This is still work in progress, use at your own risk and don't complain about bugs and missing features ðŸ˜‰__

This extension aims to track your coding activity. It does this by registering keypresses, scrolling and changes of open files. At most every minute a tracking record is uploaded to the server. The records can then be analyzed in order to extract information about your coding activity.

## Server - _Coming soon_

For correct functionality a backend server is necessary. It is currently work in progress but will be released soon...
